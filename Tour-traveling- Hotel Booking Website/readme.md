# Tour travel website

### Introduction 
The travel and tourism industry has evolved significantly in the modern era, with more people seeking seamless solutions to plan their trips and book accommodations online. Our Hotel Room Booking Website is designed to offer an efficient and user-friendly platform for travellers worldwide. This website aims to simplify the booking process by allowing users to browse various destinations, filter options based on their specific budget, and securely complete bookings. By focusing on intuitive navigation and customized filters, we aim to enhance the overall travel planning experience for users.


### Problem Statement: 
Travel planning, particularly finding accommodations, often presents several challenges. 
Travelers frequently encounter issues such as: 
- Overwhelming Choices: Many booking platforms list thousands of accommodations, 
making it difficult for users to find options that align with their preferences. 
- Inadequate Filtering Options: Limited filtering for location, and budget can make it 
hard for travelers to narrow down choices effectively. 

Addressing these issues is essential to creating a better experience for travelers, particularly 
those who want to streamline the booking process and feel confident in their choices.
